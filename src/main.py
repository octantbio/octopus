"""Main script for running the computational pipeline.

This script acts as an entrypoint into OCTOPUS. This does not replace any
components of the pipeline, but simply spares users the trouble of dealing with
the Makefile interface. All pipeline-level arguments (like "--mem") can be
documented and dealt with here. Ultimately, this script simply calls `make`.
Example usage of this script:

    /path/to/main.py

In practice, this script is used as an entrypoint to our Docker container

Users who want more control should simply bypass this script and continue to 
work with `make` directly.
