# OCTOPUS Wiki

The original wetlab protocol for OCTOPUS can be found on our [Bench Protocol](Bench-Protocol.md) page.

We developed a protocol that uses RCA ([rolling circle amplification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_circle_replication)) to avoid the time consuming and error-prone lysate generation step.
We _highly_ recommend this updated [Bench Protocol with RCA, which you can read about here](Bench-Protocol-with-RCA.md).

You can refer to these resources for information on our computational protocol:
- [Installation](Installation.md)
- [Pipeline Details](Pipeline-Details.md)
- [Running the Analysis Pipeline](Running-the-Analysis-Pipeline.md)

For a deeper dive into the implementation details of OCTOPUS, you can refer to these pages:
